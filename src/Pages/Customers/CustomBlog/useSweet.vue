          Upstash Kafka as the primary messaging engine <br />
          to allow cross-microservice communication

          As a Customer Data Platform (CDP), Sweet ingests vast amounts of data from various
          sources, including ecommerce, email, and marketing platforms, as well as live behavioral
          data from website users. Sweet relies on Upstash's managed Kafka service as its primary
          messaging engine, enabling different microservices to communicate seamlessly. These
          services publish key events that other services might need to act upon. For example, when
          the ecommerce data sync service creates an order in the system, it triggers a need for
          Sweet to update certain customer stats. This is due to changes in metrics like the total
          number of orders, sales, and other key customer-related figures. The customer stats
          service subscribes to these events and recalculates the relevant statistics. While this is
          a simplified illustration, the primary use of Upstash Kafka for Sweet is to facilitate
          cross-microservice communication within their real-time system

            Upstash Kafka has essentially allowed us to focus more on shipping new features and
            provide a higher quality service, as well as simplify our operations by using a managed
            service rather than setting it up and managing it ourselves.
